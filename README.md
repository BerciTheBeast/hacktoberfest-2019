# hacktoberfest-2019

Hacktoberfest requires 4 PRs to be eligible for a Tshirt.

Naturally, this is a bit difficult to pull of considering neither git nor github are making this easy.

This, however, is not a thing that will stop me easily (altho it is close).

But alas, Tshirts have to be earned (usually).
